<header>Nikola Tesla</header>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="tesla.jpg"></div>
<p>Inventor Nikola Tesla contributed to the development of the alternating-current electrical system
    that's widely used today and discovered the rotating magnetic field (the basis of most AC
    machinery).</p>
<p>Inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the United
    States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several
    patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse. His
    1891 invention, the "Tesla coil," is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New
    York City on January 7, 1943.</p>
<p>Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now Smiljan, Croatia. He was one of five
    children which included siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica, in the family. Tesla's
    interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small
    household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin
    Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the
    priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences. After studying at the
    Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt); the
    Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague during the 1870s, Tesla
    moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange. It was while in
    Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of
    trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for
    America.</p>
<p>In 1884 Tesla arrived the United States with little more than the clothes on his back and a
    letter of introduction to famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based
    electrical works were fast becoming the standard in the country. Edison hired Tesla, and the two
    men were soon working tirelessly alongside each other, making improvements to Edison's
    inventions. However, several months later, the two parted ways due to a conflicting
    business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different
    personalities: While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success,
    Tesla was commercially out-of-tune and somewhat vulnerable.</p>
<p>After parting ways with Edison, in 1885 Tesla received funding for the Tesla Electric Light
    Company and was tasked by his investors to develop improved arc lighting. After successfully
    doing so, however, Tesla was forced out of the venture and for a time had to work as a manual
    laborer in order to survive. His luck changed in 1887, when he was able to find interest in his
    AC electrical system and funding for his new Tesla Electric Company. Setting straight to work,
    by the end of the year, Tesla had successfully filed several patents for AC-based
    inventions. </p>
<p>Tesla's AC system eventually caught the attention of American engineer and business man George
    Westinghouse, who was seeking a solution to supplying the nation with long-distance power.
    Convinced that Tesla's inventions would help him achieve this, in 1888 he purchased his patents
    for $60,000 in cash and stock in the Westinghouse Corporation. As interest in an
    alternating-current system grew, Tesla and Westinghouse were put in direct competition with
    Thomas Edison, who was intent on selling his direct-current system to the nation. A
    negative-press campaign was soon waged by Edison, in an attempt to undermine interest in AC
    power. Tesla, for his part, continued in his work and would patent several more inventions
    during this period, including the "Tesla coil," which laid the foundation for wireless
    technologies and is still used in radio technology today.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Thomas Edison, the Westinghouse Corporation was chosen to supply the lighting
    at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and Tesla conducted demonstrations of his
    AC system there. Two years later, in 1895, Tesla designed what was among the first AC
    hydroelectric power plants in the United States, at Niagara Falls. The following year, it was
    used to power the city of Buffalo, New York, a feat that was highly publicized throughout the
    world. With its repeat successes and favorable press, the alternating-current system would
    quickly become the preeminent power system of the 20th century, and it has remained the
    worldwide standard ever since.</p>
<p>n addition to his AC system and coil, throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and
    developed ideas for a number of other important inventions—most of which were officially
    patented by other inventors—including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and
    the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray
    technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field—the basis of most AC machinery. </p>
<p>Having become obsessed with the wireless transmission of energy, around 1900 Nikola set to work
    on his boldest project yet: to build a global, wireless communication system—to be transmitted
    through a large electrical tower—for sharing information and providing free electricity
    throughout the world. With funding from a group of investors that included financial giant J. P.
    Morgan, in 1901 Tesla began work on the project in earnest, designing and building a lab with a
    power plant and a massive transmission tower on a site on Long Island, New York, that became
    known as Wardenclyffe. However, when doubts arose among his investors about the plausibility of
    Tesla's system and his rival, Guglielmo Marconi—with the financial support of Andrew Carnegie
    and Thomas Edison—continued to make great advances with his own radio technologies, Tesla had no
    choice but to abandon the project. The Wardenclyffe staff was laid off in 1906 and by 1915 the
    site had fallen into foreclosure. Two years later Tesla declared bankruptcy and the tower was
    dismantled and sold for scrap to help pay the debts he had accrued.</p>
<p>After suffering a nervous breakdown, Tesla eventually returned to work, primarily as a
    consultant. But as time went on, his ideas became progressively more outlandish and impractical.
    He also grew increasingly eccentric, devoting much of his time to the care of wild pigeons in
    New York City's parks. He even drew the attention of the FBI with his talk of building a
    powerful "death beam," which had received some interest from the Soviet Union during World World
    II. </p>
<p>Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86, in New York City,
    where he had lived for nearly 60 years. But the legacy of the work he left behind him lives on
    to this day.</p>
