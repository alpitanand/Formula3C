    <tr>
    <td>Shm</td>
    <td>Differential equation of SHM is 
        <math>
        <mfrac>
            <mn>d<sup>2</sup>x</mn>
                <mn>dt<sup>2</sup></mn>
            </mfrac></math>
        + ω<sup>2</sup>x = 0</br>
    Solutions of this equation can  both be sine or cosine functions.We conveniently choose
    x = Acos(ωt + φ) where A,φ and ω all are constants 
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
    <td>Amplitude</td>
    <td>Quantity A is known of SHM which is the magnitude of maximum value of displacement on either sides from the equilibrum position</td></tr>
    
    <tr>
    <td>Time period</td>
    <td>Time period (T) of SHM the time during whichoscillation repeat itself i.e., repeatsits one cycle of motion and it is given by 
        <math>
        <mfrac>
            <mn>2n</mn>
            <mn>ω</mn></mfrac></math>
        where ω is the angular frequency
        </td></tr>
    
    <tr>
    <td>Frequency</td>
    <td>Frequency of the SHM is the number of the complete oscillation per unit time i.e., frequency is reciprocal of the time period f=1/T.thus angular frequency ω=2πf</td></tr>
    
    <tr>
    <td>Velocity</td>
    <td>Velocity of a system executing SHM as a function of time is v = - ωAsin(ωt+φ)</td></tr>
    
    <tr>
    <td>Accelceration</td>
        <td>Acceleration of particle executing SHM is a = -ω<sup>2</sup>Acos(ωt+φ) so a = -ω<sup>2</sup>x</br>
    THis shows that acceleration is proportional to the displacement but in opposite direction</td></tr>
    

<tr>
<td>Kinetic Energy</td>
<td>At any time t KE of system in SHM is KE = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup> = (1/2)mω<Sup>2</Sup>A<sup>2</sup>sin<sup>2</sup>(ωt+φ)
    which is a function varying periodically in time</td></tr>


<tr>
<td>Potential Energy</td>
<td>PE of system in SHM at any time t is PE = (1/2)kx<sup>2</sup> = (1/2)mω<Sup>2</Sup>A<sup>2</sup>cos<sup>2</sup>(ωt+φ)</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Total Energy</td>
    <td>Total energy in SHm E = KE+PE = (1/2)mω<Sup>2</Sup>A<sup>2</sup></br>
    and it remain constant in absence of dissipative forces like frictional forces

<tr>
<td>Oscillations of a Spring mass system</td>
<td>In this case particle of mass m oscillates under the influence of hook's law restoring force given by F = -kx where k is the spring constant</br>
Angular Frequency ω = √(k/m) </br>
Time period T= 2n√(m/k)
frequency is = (1/2n)√(k/m)
Time period of both horizontal and vertical osciallation are same but spring constant have different value for horizontal and vertical motion</td>

<tr>
<td>Simple Pendulum</td>
<td>Motion of simple particle of mass m oscillates under the influenceof hook's law restoring force given by </br>
w = √(Q/L) and time period T = 2n√(L/q)
where L is the length of the spring
Here we notice that period of oscillation is independent of the mass m of the pendulum
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Compound Pendulum</td>
<td>Compund pendulum is a rigid body of any shpae capable of oscillating about the horizontal axis passing through it.</br>
such a pendulum swinging with small angle executes SHM with the time period</br>
T = 2n√(
<math>
<mfrac>
    <mn>I</mn>
    <mn>mqL</mn>
    </mfrac></math>
)
where I = moment of inertia of pendulum about the axis of suspension L is the length of the pendulum
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Damped Oscillation</td>
<td>SHM which continues indefinately without the loss of the amplitude are called free oscillation or undamped and it is not a real case.</br>
In real physical systems energy of the oscillator gradully decreases with time and oscillator will eventually come to rest.this happens becuase in actual physical systems, friction (or damping) is always present</br>
The reduction in amplitude or energy of the oscillator is called damping and oscillation are called damped
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Forced Oscillation and Response</td>
<td>Oscillations of a system under the influence of an external periodic force are called forced oscillations</br>
If frequency of externally applied driving force is equal to the natural frequency of the oscillator resonance is said to occur</td></tr>
