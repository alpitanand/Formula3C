<p>Niels Bohr was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and humanitarian whose revolutionary theories on
    atomic structures helped shape research worldwide.</p>
<p>Born on October 7, 1885, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Niels Bohr went on to become an accomplished
    physicist who came up with a revolutionary theory on atomic structures and radiation emission.
    He won the 1922 Nobel Prize in physics for his ideas and years later, after working on the
    Manhattan Project in the United States, called for responsible and peaceful applications of
    atomic energy across the world.</p>
<p>Niels Bohr was born on October 7, 1885, in Copenhagen, Denmark, to mother Ellen Adler, who was
    part of a successful Jewish banking clan, and father Christian Bohr, a celebrated physiology
    academic. The young Bohr eventually attended Copenhagen University, where he received his
    master's and doctorate in physics by 1911. During the fall of the same year, Bohr traveled to
    Cambridge, England, where he was able to follow the Cavendish Laboratory work of scientist J.J.
    Thomson.</p>
<p>In 1912, Bohr wed Margrethe Nørlund. The couple would have six children; four survived to
    adulthood and one, Aage, would become a well-known physics scientist as well.</p>
<p>Bohr’s own research led him to theorize in a series of articles that atoms give off
    electromagnetic radiation as a result of electrons jumping to different orbit levels, departing
    from a previously held model espoused by Ernest Rutherford. Though Bohr's discovery would
    eventually be tweaked by other scientists, his ideas formed the basis of future atomic
    research.</p>
<p>After teaching at Manchester’s Victoria University, Bohr settled again at Copenhagen University
    in 1916 with a professorship position. Then, in 1920, he founded the university’s Institute of
    Theoretical Physics, which he would head for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Bohr received the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on atomic structures, and he would
    continue to come up with revolutionary theories. He worked with Werner Heisenberg and other
    scientists on a new quantum mechanics principle connected to Bohr's concept of complementarity,
    which was initially presented at an Italian conference in 1927. The concept asserted that
    physical properties on an atomic level would be viewed differently depending on experimental
    parameters, hence explaining why light could be seen as both a particle and a wave, though never
    both at the same time. Bohr would come to apply this idea philosophically as well, with the
    belief that evolving concepts of physics deeply affected human perspectives. Another physicist,
    by the name of Albert Einstein, didn’t fully see eye to eye with all of Bohr's assertions, and
    their talks became renowned in scientific communities.</p>
<p>Bohr went on to work with the group of scientists who were at the forefront of research on
    nuclear fission during the late 1930s, to which he contributed the liquid droplet theory.
    Outside of his pioneering ideas, Bohr was known for his wit and warmth, and his humanitarian
    ethics would inform his later work.</p>
<p>With Adolf Hitler's rise in power, Bohr was able to offer German Jewish physicists refuge at his
    institute in Copenhagen, which in turn led to travel to the United States for many. Once Denmark
    became occupied by Nazi forces, the Bohr family escaped to Sweden, with Bohr and his son Aage
    eventually making their way to the United States. Bohr then worked with the Manhattan Project in
    Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the first atomic bomb was being created. Because he had concerns
    about how the bomb could be used, he called for future international arms control and active
    communication about the weapon between nations—an idea met with resistance by Winston Churchill
    and Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>After the end of the war, Bohr returned to Europe and continued to call for peaceful applications
    of atomic energy. In his "Open Letter to the United Nations," dated June 9, 1950, Bohr
    envisioned an "open world" mode of existence between countries that abandoned isolationism for
    true cultural exchange.</p>
<p>He helped to establish CERN, a Europe-based particle physics research facility, in 1954 and put
    together the Atoms for Peace Conference of 1955. In 1957, Bohr received the Atoms for Peace
    Award for his trailblazing theories and efforts to use atomic energy responsibly.</p>
<p>Bohr was a prolific writer with more than 100 publications to his name. After having a stroke, he
    died on November 18, 1962, in Copenhagen. Bohr’s son Aage shared with two others the 1975 Nobel
    Prize in Physics for his research on motion in atomic nuclei.</p>
