<p>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (or C.V. Raman), was born on 7th November 1888 in
    Thiruvanaikaval, Trichinopoly, present-day Tiruchirapalli. The innovative work of this legend
    from India, in the field of scattering of light earned him Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930.</p>
<p>C.V. Raman studied in St. Aloysius Anglo-Indian High School in Vishakhapatnam. He completed his
    metric education at the age of 11 years and intermediate at the age of 13 years. In 1902, Raman
    joined Presidency College in Madras to do his further studies. And in 1904, he passed his B.A.
    (Bachelor of Arts) as gold medalist in Physics. Later, in 1907 he completed his M.A. (Master of
    Arts) degree with the highest distinctions.</p>
<p>He started his career by working in government sector, but in 1917 he left that work after he got
    chance to be the first Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta. At the same
    time he continued his research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS),
    Calcutta, there he became the Honorary Secretary. This was the time when he did all the
    innovations related to light in physics. During this period he did Noble Prize winning work. He
    discovered that, when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light
    changes in wavelength. This phenomenon is now called Raman scattering and is the result of the
    Raman Effect. In 1954, he was honored with the highest civilian award in India, the Bharat
    Ratna.</p>
<p>CV Raman experienced a major heart attack during the last of October in 1970, while working in
    his laboratory. After the attack he was referred to hospital where after living some days, he
    refused to stay there and said that he wanted to die in the garden of his Institute called Raman
    Research Institute. And there he took his last breath on 21st November 1970.
</p>
<p> He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society early in his career (1924) and knighted in 1929.
    ● In 1930 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics.
    ● In 1941 he was awarded the Franklin Medal.
    ● In 1954 he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, highest civilian award in India
    ● He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize in 1957.
    ● In 1998, the American Chemical Society and Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science
    recognised Raman's discovery as an International Historic Chemical Landmark.
    ● India celebrates National Science Day on 28 February of every year to commemorate the
    discovery of the Raman effect in 1928 in his honour.</p>
