<header>Galelio Galilei</header>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="galilio.jpg"></div>
<p>Galileo Galilei was born on 15 February 1564 in Pisa. (He is one of the few famous people known
    by his first name rather than his surname). Galileo was the first of 6 or ,some say, 7 children.
    His father was a musician and although the family were fairly well off they were by no means
    rich.</p>
<p>Galileo Galilei was born on 15 February 1564 in Pisa. (He is one of the few famous people known
    by his first name rather than his surname). Galileo was the first of 6 or ,some say, 7 children.
    His father was a musician and although the family were fairly well off they were by no means
    rich.</p>
<p>At that time the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was held in very high esteem and many people
    accepted his ideas without question. However Galileo did not. Aristotle said that if two
    objects, a heavy one and light one both fall from a height the large one will reach the ground
    first. According to legend Galileo tested the theory by dropping two different weights from the
    leaning Tower of Pisa. Both hit the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>However many people now believe this famous experiment is a myth. It never actually took place.
    In any case other scholars had already reached the conclusion that Aristotle was wrong.</p>
<p>However Galileo's criticism of Aristotle irritated the other staff at the university and in 1592
    his contract was not renewed. Instead from 1592 to 1610 Galileo taught at the university of
    Padua.</p>
<p>Galileo Galilei never married but he did have 3 children, 2 girls and a boy.</p>
<p>Then in 1609 Galileo heard of a new invention from Holland. A man named Hans Lippershey (c
    1570-1619) had invented the telescope. Galileo made his own telescope and soon improved it.</p>
<p>Using a telescope Galileo was able to see several things invisible to the naked eye. Firstly he
    could see many stars not visible without a telescope. Secondly the ancient Greeks believed that
    the Moon was smooth. Looking through a telescope Galileo could see the Moon's surface is
    actually rough, with mountains and craters. He also discovered 4 small 'moons' orbiting the
    planet Jupiter. At the time these were astonishing discoveries. Until then nobody knew that any
    of the other planets, apart from Earth, had 'moons'.</p>
<p>Also in 1610 Galileo discovered that Venus has phases like the Moon.</p>
<p>In 1610 Galileo wrote a book called Siderius Nuncius or the Sidereal Messenger. Also that year he
    was made mathematician and philosopher of the grand duke of Tuscany (at that time Italy was
    divided into many small states of which Tuscany was one).</p>
<p>At that time astronomers were debating sunspots. A German named Christoph Scheiner claimed that
    they were satellites of the sun. In 1613 Galileo argued that sunspots are actually on the
    surface of the sun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in 1543 a theory by the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus was published Until his
    time people believed that the sun, moon and planets orbit the earth. Copernicus argued that the
    earth and the other planets orbit the sun. At first the church did not have a problem with his
    theory. However opinion gradually hardened and in 1616 the Copernican theory was declared
    heretic20.</p>
<p>There is a passage in the Old Testament where a prophet named Joshua commanded the sun to stand
    still in the sky (Joshua 10:12-13). Some scholars said this meant the sun must move. Of course,
    Joshua knew nothing about Astronomy. To him the sun appeared to move across the sky. Naturally
    he would command the sun to stand still and to him it would have appeared to stand still. The
    church's objection to the Copernican theory was based on a misinterpretation of the Bible.</p>
<p>However Galileo was a resolute supporter of the Copernican theory. In 1632 he published a book
    called Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. As a result he was summoned to Rome to
    be examined by the inquisition. He arrived in January 1633. Galileo was threatened with torture
    unless he renounced the Copernican theory. Not surprisingly he agreed to do so. Nevertheless he
    was put under house arrest for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>In 1634 Galileo published a book about mechanics called Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences.
    Then in 1637 he noticed that the Moon moves slightly from side to side. Unfortunately in 1638 he
    went blind. Galileo died on 8 January 1642 aged 77.</p>
